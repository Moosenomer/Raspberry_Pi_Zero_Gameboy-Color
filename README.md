# Gameboy-Color-Raspberry-Pi-Mod

## Description & Background Info
A github page to highlight the Raspberry Pi Zero W portable emulator in a Gameboy color shell.
This project has been in the works for a year, and the final result is a functional portable emulator and computer!

## Features of the Project
- Full support for GameBoy, Gameboy Color, NES, SUPER-NES and other retro game consoles with RetroPi
- 2.2 inch TFT display overclocked and tweaked for 60fps gameplay
- Original Gameboy Shell
- 2500 mA battery 
- Replica Gameboy controller PCB for use with original GameBoy buttons
- Adafruit 2.5W Mono amp paired with headphone jack and 1W Speaker
- Project Cost was ~135 Canadian Dollars (100USD)

## Be Warned...
This guide includes general assembly tips, but is not a full guide as I don't have the resources to effectively guide someone through ever step of construction. Its a long project, and requires a lot of patience and planning ahead especially come final assembly.


## Acquiring Hardware
### Crucial Components
1. Buy a Gameboy Color Shell. There are plenty of broken Gameboys available on ebay that ship internationally, and plenty of shells that are inexpensive on Aliexpress. Please don't break a perfectly operational Gameboy, that would break my heart.
2. Source a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Best sites are smaller electronics retailers, especially in Canada. I used PiShop to purchase mine.
3. The 2.2 Inch ili9341 TFT display was sourced from Aliexpress, non touch versions of these boards are ideal since they have better colors. They can be found on similar sites as well, buy at own risk!
4. Adafruit PowerBoost 1000. Check website for availability, we will be likely drawing close to 500mA at max load so its worth purchasing this over the PowerBoost 500.
5. Adafruit D class 2.5W Mono Amp. Any mono amp works, this is just what was easy to source (and had documentation).
6. SD card, 32GB or larger. The Pi zero is only capable of emulating NES, Gameboy and GBA titles well which don't have large file sizes so don't worry too much. Larger is better, and a good quality card should be used for longevity and performance.
7. Battery, 2500mAH 3.7V LiPo. The larger the battery the better, in this build I 3D printed a custom cartridge to put the battery inside, this is not necessary however I can only guarantee this will work. The size I used is roughly (4.6cm x 5.8cm x 0.5cm).
8. 1W, 8ohm Speaker, Headphone Jack, USB-C Breakout Board, LED. Source from wherever, a local retailer is always the best!
9. Capacitors (33nF, 10uF), Resistors (270ohm, 150ohm x2, ~420ohm). Since these are used to create a filter, use good quality components if possible, I didn't because of interesting life choices.

### Not So Obvious Components
1. Wire. Lots of it. I used 22 AWG wire however it was not solidcore. This made assembly a royal pain in the ass as every connection need the stranded wire to be compromised in order to create reliable solder joints. Also two different colours really help with assembly, and personally I believe the aesthetic is nice.
2. Heat-shrink tubing, while not required it comes in handy during final assembly when some wires need to be shorter or longer in some sections.
