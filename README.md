# Gameboy-Color-Raspberry-Pi-Mod

## Introduction
### Descrpition & Background Info
A github page to highlight the Raspberry Pi Zero W portable emulator in a Gameboy color shell.
This project has been in the works for a year, and the final result is a functional portable emulator and computer!

### Features of the Project
- Full support for GameBoy, Gameboy Color, NES, SUPER NES and other retro game consoles with RetroPi
- __ inch __ display overclocked and tweaked for smooth and crisp gameplay
- __ mA battery 
- Custom PCB for use with **original** GameBoy buttons & speaker
- Adafruit speaker and power control
- The overall cost should be below $200 USD

### Be Warned...
This guide includes general assembly tips, but is not a full guide as I dont have the ressources to effectively guide someone through ever step of construction.
I think anyone is capable of completing this project, however it is challanging and requires some electronics background and patience.

## Aquiring Hardware
#### Crutial Components
1. Buy a Gameboy Color Shell. There are plenty of broken Gameboys avalible on ebay that ship internationally, and plenty of shells that are inexpensive on aliexpress. Please dont break a perfectly operational Gameboy, that would break my heart.
2. Source a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Best sites are smaller electronics retailers, especially in Canada. I used Pishop to purchase mine.
3. The 2.2 Inch ili9341 TFT display was sourced from Aliexpress, non touch versions of these boards are ideal since they have better colours. They can be found on similar sites as well, buy at own risk!
4. Adafruit PowerBoose 1000. Check website for avalibility, we will be likely drawing close to 500mA at max load so its worth purchasing this over the powerboost 500.
5. Adafruit D class 2.5W Mono Amp. Any mono amp works, this is just what was easy to source (and had documentation).
6. SD card, 32GB or larger. The pi zero is only capable of emulating NES, GAMEBOY and GBA titles well which dont have large file sizes so dont worry too much. Larger is better, and a good quality card should be used for longevity and preformance.
7. Battery, 2500mAH 3.7V Lipo. The larger the battery the better, in this build I 3D printed a custom cartidge to put the battery inside, this is not nesecarry however I can only guarentee this will work.


#### Not So Obvious Components
1. Wire, Personally I used 16AWG wire and it's a bit overkill for sure. You can use 18AWG wire for sure, just make sure that you get the right colors that will fit with the build and some that you can use in other projects as well. Different colors will also help, especially with positive and negative wire situations.
2. 
3. Heatshrink tubing, while not required is a very good addition to any electronics project. Keeps everything very clean and prevents shorts when cramming everything together in final assembly. 
4. Copper Strip perf board, this will be used to create the simple PCB for our buttons. 


### Tools
- Multimeter
- Soldering Iron, Fine tip preferably
- Wire Strippers
